# Project Name

Project Pizza - first week of Javascript - create a straightforward order for a "pizzeria" step by step in prompts.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
I've gone back to the live session from Tuesday a lot, in 0,5 speed! Looking over the examples and also just trying to get an idea of how it all connects and what to put where-and why.
I really tried to understand what I was doing this week, i.e not "just" copying but focus more on doing basic solutions that work rather than trying something cool just to put it in the code. 
I'm not gonna say I followed this completely but in general I feel at the end of this week that I'm starting to see the patterns. Doing that part of the stretch goals, looking through everything and seeing how it all connects was interesting.

I think I was surprised at how fast it went the first steps and then when I started to rethink and reorganize, it might've become better (and usable in the end) but also complicated my timeline. In the end, it was a light project with a lot to learn to do it so a lot of work that's not in the project itself.
If I had more time then I would probably want to learn more on what you can do with the parseInt, for other projects and ways in this project.
