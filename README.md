## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
I really tried to understand what I was doing this week, i.e not "just" copying but focus more on doing basic solutions that work rather than trying something cool just to put it in the code. 
I'm not gonna say I followed this completely but in general I feel at the end of this week that I'm starting to see the patterns. Doing that part of the stretch goals, looking through everything and seeing how it all connects was interesting.
